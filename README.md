# RadioX

RadioX ðŸ“» is an Android app that fetch and cache radio stations from [radio-browser API](https://de1.api.radio-browser.info/).

## ðŸ“» Tech stack ðŸ˜Ž
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
- [Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) , [Flow](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/) for asynchronous tasks.
- [Compose](https://developer.android.com/compose) Jetpack Compose is Androidâ€™s recommended modern toolkit for building native UI. It simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android. Quickly bring your app to life with less code, powerful tools, and intuitive Kotlin APIs.
- [Media3](https://developer.android.com/media/media3) for media player.
- Jetpack
    - [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture)
        - ViewModel: Manages UI-related data.
        - Room: used to construct reliable caching for offline support.
        - [Paging 3 for Compose](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/v3-overview)
          helps you load and display pages of data from a larger dataset from local storage or over
          the network.
            - [Remote Mediator API](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/paging/RemoteMediator)
- [Retrofit2 & OkHttp3](https://github.com/square/retrofit): networking.
- [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi/): A modern JSON library for Kotlin and Java.
- [Koin](https://insert-koin.io/docs/quickstart/android/) Koin is a lightweight DI framework for Kotlin and Android.
- [Coil Compose](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil): Loading images from network and caches it.
- [Timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber): A logger with a small API footprint.
- Architecture
    - The RadioX app follows MVVM - Repository Pattern Clean Architecture (View - ViewModel - Model) - Domain - Data.

- The data is bumped directly from the database to the UI over
  the [Paging 3](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/v3-overview)
  PagingSource Assisted
  with [Remote Mediator](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/paging/RemoteMediator)
  which controls the process of loading new pages from the Remote Source
  and cache it on the database, then the database notifies the UI about the new changes over the Flow API, so based on this mechanism the database becomes the source of truth of the data in the app, and the remote mediator calculates the pages based on stored PagingKeys
  that contains:

        - nextKey -> next page number
        - prevKey -> previous page number
        - currentPage -> current page number


The following image demonstrates the flow of the process
